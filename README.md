# Implementation of concepts of 'spread' and 'rest' in JS

<h3>Spread : expands an iterable into multiple values</h3>
<p>
Iterable means array or string or any collection .
Console.log(…arr);
Console.log(…”apnacollege”);
</p>
<p>
Spread is used to create a copy of array or string called array literals
Spread is also used for object literals.
</p>
<h3>Rest : is opposite of spread</h3>
<p>
Allows a function to take indefinite number of arguments and bundle them in an array.

There is inbuilt collection in JS called arguments. It is an collection but not an array. So, we can not apply array methods on arguments. So as to make apply array methods on arguments we use the concept of rest.
